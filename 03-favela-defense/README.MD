# 3️⃣ Favela Defense

A strategy-defense game set in dense, vertical urban environments inspired by informal settlements. The player manages defensive positions, supplies, and units to hold territory under escalating pressure. Emphasis is placed on terrain usage, improvised structures, and resource management rather than traditional military power.
